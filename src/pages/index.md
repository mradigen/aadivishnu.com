<!-- I'm a 17 y/o computer hobbyist who loves programming, building new tech, and breaking existing ones. I started out with [game development](https://adigen.is-a.dev/games), worked as a web developer, and fiddled around a lot in [the world of Linux](https://github.com/mradigen). -->
<!-- My original love for tech began with hardware where I built a 4-bit ALU out of bare transistors at the age of 9. -->

I'm a 17 y/o developer who loves to code, build things, and automate workflows. I've worked in wide range of tech domains from building CPUs to creating Linux distros. My original love for tech began at the age of 9 where I made my first 4-bit ALU out of transistors.

Outside of tech, I enjoy [making music](https://youtube.com/adigen), [creating voxel art](https://instagram.com/mradigen), and [playing flight simulators](https://warthunder.com).
