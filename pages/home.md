# Hey there, ADIGEN here!

I'm a teenage computer hobbyist who loves programming, building, and breaking stuff. I started out with [game development](https://adigen.is-a.dev/games), worked as a web developer, and fiddled around a lot in the [world of Linux](https://github.com/mradigen/dotfiles). Right now I've taken a step back from tech to focus on improving my management skills.
