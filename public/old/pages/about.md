# Hey there, ADIGEN here!

I'm a teenage computer hobbyist who loves programming, building, and breaking stuff. I started out with [game development](https://adigen.is-a.dev/games), worked as a web developer, and fiddled around a lot in the [world of Linux](https://github.com/mradigen/dotfiles).

My original love for tech began with hardware where I built a 4-bit ALU out of bare transistors at the age of 9.

Outside of tech, I enjoy [making music](https://youtube.com/ADIGEN), [creating voxel art](https://instagram.com/mradigen), and [playing flight simulators](https://warthunder.com).
